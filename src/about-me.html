    <p>
        <span class="newthought">I decided</span> to put an "About me" page because I felt that the TL;DR story I left
        at <a href='/'><code>HOME</code></a>{{
            sidenote("at-home", "forgive the pun, but calling it \"home\" instead of \"the homepage\" feels a little more cozy, no?")
        }} was a little lacking. But as I sit here trying to figure out what aspects of my life I should share with the world, I think&mdash;idk 
        what to write ü´§. Really though, can one's whole life story be captured on the ones and zeroes of a website? If you want to chat more about 
        my life or yours, please reach out! I left my email at <a href='/'><code>HOME</code></a> as well üôÇ.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyway, in an attempt to capture who I am, below is a stream of consciousness of everything that I like, and everything that is me üòå{{
            sidenote("emoji", "if the (possibly excessive) presence of emojis in this website feels anachronistic or out of place, just think of emojis as the written equivalent of non-verbal communication in daily conversation to convey more layers of meaning ü§î")
        }}. Enjoy!

    <h2>Why the website?</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
        <span class="newthought">The source code</span> of this website lives on my desktop in a folder labeled ‚Äú<code>mkII</code>‚Äù.
        Once upon a time, I created "<a href='https://gpalzate.github.io/archive/'>Mk I</a>{{
            sidenote("mki", "\"<i>dude, that doesn't look like you.</i>\"<br><br>- a friend after looking at the picture of 2017-me on my old portfolio.")
        }}" to showcase my journey from student in computer science to software engineer. Mk II, which lies before you here, is a more stripped-down,
        straightforward revival of that, but the narrative has shifted its gaze away from the professional journey and onto my personal identity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Moving forward, any fun new discoveries I have about myself and the world will find its way here, in the hopes that this website will evolve
        into an increasingly accurate reflection of who I am.

    <h3>Music</h3>
    <p>
        Trivial observation: the music we listen to is always either <i>a</i>) a new discovery, or <i>b</i>) a revisit of a familiar tune.
        Our music tastes are always changing and I think they tell a lot about a person, so here are my current favorite songs for each of
        these two categories.
