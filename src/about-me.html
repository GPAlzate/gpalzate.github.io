        <span class="newthought">...on second thought, let's just chat </span>üòÑ. I decided to put an "About me" page because
         I felt that the TLDR story I left at <a href="/"><code>HOME</code></a> was a little lacking. But can one's whole life story really 
         be captured on the ones and zeroes of a webpage? If you want to talk more about my life or yours, please reach out! 
         I left my email at <a href="/"><code>HOME</code></a> as well. For more conversation starters, below is a stream of consciousness
         of everything that I like, and everything that is me üòå{{

         }}. Enjoy!
