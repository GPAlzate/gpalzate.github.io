        <span class="newthought">...on second thought, let's just chat </span>üòÑ. I decided to put an "About me" page because
         I felt that the TLDR story I left at <a href="/"><code>HOME</code></a> was a little lacking. But can one's whole life story really 
         be captured on the ones and zeroes of a webpage? If you want to talk more about my life or yours, please reach out! 
         I left my email at <a href="/"><code>HOME</code></a> as well. For more conversation starters, below is a stream of consciousness
         of everything that I like, and everything that is me üòå{{
            sidenote("emoji", "if the (possibly excessive) presence of emojis in this website feels anachronistic or out of place, just think of emojis as the written equivalent of non-verbal communication in daily conversation to convey more layers of meaning ü§î")
         }}. Enjoy!

    <h3>Music</h3>
    <p>
        To try and bring some order to my disorganized liked songs on Spotify, I've constructed some tables as follows: the left-most column contains the genres I listen to, and each row contains
        a sample S-tier{{
            sidenote("s-tier", "a term originating from video game culture, \"S-tier\" is used to describe the best in a given category. what're your S-tier songs??")
        }} work that captures what I appreciate about the given genre.
