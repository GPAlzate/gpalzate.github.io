        <span class="newthought">...on second thought, let's just chat </span>üòÑ. I decided to put an "About me" page because
         I felt that the TLDR story I left at <a href="/"><code>HOME</code></a> was a little lacking. But can one's whole life story really 
         be captured on the ones and zeroes of a webpage? If you want to talk more about my life or yours, please reach out! 
         I left my email at <a href="/"><code>HOME</code></a> as well. For more conversation starters, below is a stream of consciousness
         of everything that I like, and everything that is me üòå{{
            sidenote("emoji", "if the (possibly excessive) presence of emojis in this website feels anachronistic or out of place, just think of emojis as the written equivalent of non-verbal communication in daily conversation to convey more layers of meaning ü§î")
         }}. Enjoy!

    <h3>Music</h3>
    <p>
        Trivial observation: the music we listen to is always either <i>a</i>) a new discovery, or <i>b</i>) a revisit of a familiar tune.
        Our music tastes are always changing and I think they tell a lot about a person, so here are my current favorite songs for each of
        these two categories.
