        <span class="newthought">...on second thought, let's just chat </span>😄. I decided to put an "About me" page because
         I felt that the TLDR story I left at <a href="/"><code>HOME</code></a> was a little lacking. But can one's whole life story really 
         be captured on the ones and zeroes of a webpage? If you want to talk more about my life or yours, please reach out! 
         I left my email at <a href="/"><code>HOME</code></a> as well. For more conversation starters, below is a stream of consciousness
         of everything that I like, and everything that is me 😌{{
            sidenote("emoji", "emojis are the written equivalent of the non-verbal communication in daily conversation to convey more layers of meaning. 
            if the (possibly excessive) presence of emojis in this website feels anachronistic or out of place, know that I am simply writing as I would speak 😅!")
         }}. Enjoy!
