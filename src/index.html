        My story, TL;DR: I was born and raised in the Philippines. In 2017, I moved to the US where I graduated
        with a <a href="https://www.pomona.edu/academics/departments/computer-science">Computer Science</a> degree from 
        <a href="https://www.pomona.edu/">Pomona College</a>, after which I found myself in San
        Francisco where my software engineering career began.  Now, I am:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <s>a backend software engineer on the quoting and ordering team{{
            sidenote("qos", "if you've ever redeemed a LinkedIn Premium free trial (or perhapsâ€”even purchased a Premium plan?), you've probably used what I built!")
        }} at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a></s> 
            </li>
            <li>building an AI product back home :)</li>

        In my free time I enjoy learning new instruments{{
            sidenote("music", "most recently: the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashaka'>kashakas</a>, to try and expand my horizons beyond traditional Western musical instruments.")
        }}, making latte art, and playing badminton~
